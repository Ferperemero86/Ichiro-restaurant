1. HOW IT WORKS.

    - Customers can navigate through the different pages in order to see the menu and different content about the restaurant.
      This website contains 2 main areas:

       1. Customers area:
        Here customers can see info about the restaurant and do orders for collection and to take away. There is a basket             showing the number of items they keep ordering and at the end there is a check out page where they need to 
        provide their phone and email info. Once the order is made the owner will receive an email message with the order and         he, from the Admin area, will   accept or reject the order. Once this is done, the client will receive an email               confirmation of the order.
  
       2. Admin area:
        In this area the restaurant's owner can find:
         1. Pending Orders: Here he can see the number of orders with its details to accept or reject.
         2. Accepted/Rejected Orders: Here he can search the accepted/rejected orders he made any time. There is a search form
                                      where he can search a specific order by day.
         3. Stock: Here he can update all the items details like price, description or type. Aswell add or delete items.
                   This area updates dynamically the menu page where the customers can see in real time all the changes 
                   made by the customer.
         4. Profile: Here he can edit all his info like username, email or password. In case he forgets his username or                            password,in the login page there is a recovery link where he can get an email with a unique 
                     link and unique use in order to get the change password form and get a new customized password.
